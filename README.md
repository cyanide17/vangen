# Vangen

Vangen is a simple, machine-agnostic, deterministic  crash reproducing utility for [ir0nc0w](https://github.com/ir0nc0w)/[hypervisor-fuzz](https://github.com/ir0nc0w/hypervisor-fuzz) (_private_)

> Vangen enables you to reproduce crash on **van**illa linux by providing kernel module **gen**erated from test case.

### Prerequisites
- hyfuzz project source file
- test case log generated by hyfuzz
- vanilla linux running on hypervisor

### Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cyanide17/vangen.git
$ cd vangen
$ vi script.sh
```
set `PRJ_PATH` to your hyfuzz directory. *(line 2)*
it is set to `~/Desktop/hypervisor-fuzz` as default.

set `PORT` to port number you opened. *(line 3)*
it is set to `2345` as default.

### Usage
First run linux on hypervisor such as qemu.
```
$ ./script.sh 'relative-path-to-log-file'"
```
for basic usage.
```
$ ./script.sh 'relative-path-to-log-file' -dbg"
```
for debugging.
this leaves debris from intermediate processes.
